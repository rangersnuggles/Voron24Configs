# Voron 2.4 Configs
Current working version and backups of my Voron 2.4 Rev config files.

Installed Hardware: LDO 2.4 Rev C Kit, Stealthburner w/ Phaetus Rapido, BTT Knomi and Rainbow Barf LED wired into a BTT SB2209 Can Toolhead attached through a BTT U2C.

WARNING: Macros are a WIP, and I'm a n00b/idiot so you definately should not use/trust them.
